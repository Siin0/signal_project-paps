The stream of data from the patient monitor constantly travels to the data storage, where it is converted into patient data and constantly checked by the alert generator. Then, the alert generator evaluated whether the patient data is worthy of an alert. We thought about making an alternate frame for this but decided that it’d be redundant considering that if the patient data isn’t worthy of an alert, then nothing happens and the system stays the same. From then onwards, the alert generated instantiates a new alert object and triggers an alert to the alert manager. The alert manager then sends the notification of this alert to the available and relevant doctors and nurses. Then, the resolution can either be solved manually or automatically. We thought that if the doctors acknowledged the condition of the patient, it’d make sense for the patient to stabilize automatically because otherwise the doctors would manually intervene. As such the case for automatic resolution is in the case where the doctors acknowledge the condition of the patient, then eventually via the constant stream of data between the monitor of the patient and the alert generator, the alert generator evaluates that the alert is no longer an emergency, creates a new alert object that is passed through to the alert manager, which then decides to close the alert. This then finalizes the lifecycle of that alert given the path of automatic resolution. The alternative is manual resolution, which is done by the available doctors and nurses, who then close the alert (possibly also from the alert manager) and update the patient information accordingly.
