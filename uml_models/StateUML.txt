First, the alert is initialized, which leads it to the generated state. From then on, the generated alert can enter the sent state. This is because the only path the initialized alert can take after being created is becoming generated, which only leads to becoming sent. We thought that it was unlikely that the alert would be automatically resolved before it got sent, so a generated alert automatically gets sent to the sent state via the alert manager. Moreover, if an alert is to be generated, it must mean that the monitor read that the patient had breached safe thresholds. Afterwards, the sent state sends the alert notification to all available and relevant doctors and nurses. From the sent state, the alert can either be manually resolved or acknowledged. If the alert is treated manually, then the alert is closed and has therefore resolved. Otherwise, the alert is acknowledged and will either eventually be treated manually or treated automatically. We thought that once acknowledged, the doctors or nurses could take either path, or if they change the threshold values on the data storage, then the alert can be identified as automatically resolved. Once the alert reaches the resolved state, it is eventually deleted and thus the lifecycle of the alert ends and the issue reaches resolution.
